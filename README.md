Insigen
======= 
"Insigen," short for "Insights Generator," is a new approach towards topic modelling designed to enhance the understanding of textual content. Its purpose is to empower users to gain deeper knowledge from articles or documents by offering the following key features:

- Topic Distribution: Insigen helps users assess the thematic composition of a given text. It estimates the relevance of different topics within the text, allowing readers to understand which subjects or themes are prominent and to what extent.

- Frequency Distribution using Word Cloud: Insigen presents a visual representation of word and phrase frequencies, where the size of each term reflects its significance. By identifying important terms and n-grams (multi-word phrases), it offers a glimpse into the key elements of the text.

- Extractive Summary: Insigen employs a PageRank algorithm, inspired by Google's ranking method, to assess the importance of sentences within the text. It generates a summary that distills the most significant and relevant sentences, providing users with a concise and informative overview of the content.
